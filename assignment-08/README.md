### Interactivity and Affordances

Affordances are interactive clues, hints, instructions or context about an interactive object or element that affords the user information about its use.

Advantages: Third party sites can host larger files for you, reducing the bandwidth strain on your site. This is also more secure in terms of protecting yourself from copy write infringement.

Disadvantages: SEO Drawbacks. The hosting site will receive the search engine optimization benefits.  Loss of control, and reliability of delivery. Larger sites are more prone to make updates that may effect your content delivery, and you are at the whim of their ad server for what types, lengths and quantity of ads will appear on your videos, potentially harming your brand/goal.
