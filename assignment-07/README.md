### Forms

Describe any forms you've come across while browsing the web. What purposes do they serve?

The forms on healthcare.gov are very straightforward and easy to understand. Prior to accessing the form, visitors are asked questions (not sure you qualify? and ready to apply?) to help them navigate to the proper form. The purpose of these forms are to help people understand whether or not they fit the proper criteria to enroll for health insurance outside of an established enrollment period and to provide a way to apply for insurance coverage. It would be challenging to actually apply for coverage without these electronic forms (such as if we had to print, fill out, and mail the forms).
